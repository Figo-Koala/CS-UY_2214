1.
	In a write-through policy, every time data is updated it is written to both the cache and main memory, keeping main memory always current but increasing average write latency.
In a write-back policy, updates are made only in the cache and written to main memory later, when that cache line is evicted; this speeds up repeated writes but needs extra mechanisms to keep cache and main memory consistent.


2.
	In a write-around policy, write operations bypass the cache and go straight to main memory, avoiding the cost of loading data into the cache when it may not be reused. In contrast, a write-allocate policy brings the block into the cache on a write miss and updates it there, which is advantageous when the written data is likely to be accessed again soon, improving cache utilization and performance.


3.
	Fully associative cache with 1 byte blocks.

	a. Hit ratio = 31/32 = 96.87%. The total size does not effect the hit ratio since we never go back to used addresses.
	b.5+ 1/32 * 80 = 7.5
