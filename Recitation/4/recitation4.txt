1)Difference:E15 has only 4 bits register while E20 has 16 bits
	     E15 has 16 memory cells while E20 has 8192 memory cells
  Similarityes: Both E15 and E20 support logic operations and arithmetic calculations
		Both E15 and E20 have similar instruction sets that focusing on a limited set of instructions but can run quickly.


2a) 000 001 010 100 0100
Compares the value of Rg1 with Rg2, setting Rg4 to 1 if Rg1 is less than Rg2,
and to 0 otherwise.
PC+1
No modify in memory

2b) 010 000 000 000 1111
This unconditionally jump to the address of label foobar, which is 15.
It fills the PC with 15
No modify in registers

2c) 001 000 001 0000001
This program moves the imm value 1 to the register 1
No other registers are modified

2d) 101 001 000 0000000
This instruction stores the value in the Rg0 into the memory cell at address 0+$1, or the address stored in Rg1.
The registers are not modified but the memory address in Rg1 is turn into 0.

3a) add $0 $0 $0
This instruction tried to add value in Rg0 onto Rg0, which is always 0, and tried to store the result into Rg0, but
Rg0 is read-only, so nothing will be modified

3b) jeq $1 $0 previous
This instruction compares the value in Rg1 and Rg0, if they are equal, the program counter will jump to PC-1. since the 
imm = PC+1+(-2) = PC-1

3c) lw $5 31($2)
This instruction first calculate the memory pointer by summing the value in $2 and 31. Then the result is stored in $5.
No memory cell modified.

4a) movi $5, 34
4b) add $3, $1, $2
4c) add $6, $5, $5
4d) slti $5, $4, 10
4e) addi $2, $1, 50
     jr $2
4f) slt $7, $2, $1
     jeq $7, $0 destination
4g) lw $1, 9($0)
4h) lw $2, hyoid($0)
4i) lw $3, 0($4)
4j)    jeq $2, $0, check_second
        addi $1, $0, 2
        halt    
    check_second:
        jeq $3, $0, all_zero
        addi $1, $0, 2
        halt
    all_zero:
        addi $1, $0, 1
        halt

5)
$3: 20
$4: 70
