1. Endianism is the ways the computer stores the value of a multibyte value. There are two types of endianism: Big-endianism and Little-endianism. The big-endianism will always store the most significant bites first. For example, for 0x12345678, in the memory it looks like this: [foo] = 12, [foo+1] = 34, [foo + 2] = 56, [foo+3] = 78. If it is little endianism, the least significant bits will be stored first, and the memory looks like thsi: [foo] = 78, [foo+1] = 56, [foo + 2] = 34, [foo+3] = 12.

a) 0x00000034
b) 0x0034
c) 0x00000c99
d) 0x0c
e) 0x0000
f) 0x99000000
g) 0x0c
h) The memory address of the label numbers.

ebx is a counter, that increments by 1 each time if the least significant bit in eax is 1. eax is examined bit by bit. And the final value in ebx is the number of digits equal to 1 in eax.

mov eax, 0
mov ebx, 0
mov esi, num_array

start_loop: 
mov ecx, [esi]    
cmp ecx, 0      
je end_loop  

add eax, ecx      
cmp ecx, ebx      
jbe skip   
mov ebx, ecx
